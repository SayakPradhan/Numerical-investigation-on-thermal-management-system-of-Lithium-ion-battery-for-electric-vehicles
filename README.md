### Problem statement:</br>
</br>
To investigate the thermal runway of a lithium ion battery under several conditions.</br>
</br>

### Problem Objectives:
</br>
- Investigating the temperature at which the thermal runaway of the battery occurs.</br>
- Trying to develop a alarm system to prevent thermal runaway.</br>

### Short description</br>
</br>
- Firstly, we short circuit the battery, so that the temperature rises and thermal runway occurs. The Codes and the Temperature vs time graph is provided in the <b>'short circuit'</b> section.</br>
- Then, we take it in a real case scenario and, heat it naturally in a hot oven. The codes and the Temperature vs time graph is provided in the <b>'oven heating'</b> section.</br>
- In order to prevent thermal runway, the SEI layer is monitored and an alarm system is made which increases the value of 'h' as soon as the Sei layer decreases to 10% of its initial value. Thus, it rapidly cools down the battery and prevents thermal runway.The code and the graph is provided in the <b>'preventing thermal runway'</b> secton.
